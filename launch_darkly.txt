Launch Darkly Writeup from a Security Students Viewpoint

During this module I'm focusing on these ideas: 
  -Understanding what project architechure means within Launch Darkly 
  -How to create both projects and environments withing Launch Darkly 
  -Learning what steps are involved in mapping services and applications to project environments
  -How can Launch Darkly help DevOps teams follow secure SDLC principles & practives

Key Term: Feature Flag : Also commonly reffered to as a 'feature toggle' always teams to toggle certain features within an environments 
on or off very quickly and not have to push new code. From a security standpoints I find this very interesting because it allows 
a team to be able to quickly disable a feature that may have a security risk the team may have not been aware of. They can remediate this issue 
push the code then re-toggle the feature after it has been properly resolved.

The way LaunchDarkly implements their feature flag management is 
what makes them so special. Feature management isnt limited to software developers either. 
It can be used across many teams (Sales/Marketing/Product Managers). Anyone team that uses CI/CD can benefit from Launch darklys flag 
management.

Projects and Environments 

**PROJECT**

-A project can contain both environments and feature flags
-Feature flags are unique to a project
	-These flags can have different states unique to their environment
-Facilitates feature flag collaboration through SDLC

**Environment**
-Flags,rules,users,segments belong to env.
-The ability to have production and test environments and toggle features on or off withing each env.




Flag Delivery Network Architechtre:

-Global CDN that run the Flag Delivery Network
	-I'd be interested to learn more about how the flag delivery architecture was built and what role the security team played in it.
	-Does the long lived connection introduce any security risks?
	-The ability to set rules is a really cool feature if you want to push out features to only certatin types of users(i.e filter by Mobile or Browswer devices).
